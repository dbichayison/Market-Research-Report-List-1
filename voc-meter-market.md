<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The VOC Meter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>PID</li><li>Metal-oxide Semiconductor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The VOC meter market is primarily divided into two main types: PID (Photoionization Detector) and Metal-Oxide Semiconductor (MOS) sensors. PID meters utilize ultraviolet light to ionize VOCs, providing highly sensitive detection of a broad range of compounds, making them suitable for environmental monitoring and industrial applications. In contrast, MOS sensors rely on a change in electrical resistance when exposed to VOCs, offering cost-effective solutions for indoor air quality monitoring but with generally lower sensitivity and a narrower detection range.</p></p>
